## Overview
-------------------
Dr. Paliulis, who is working for the Biology department at Bucknell University, is performing research on chromosomes. 
In order to perform her research, Dr. Paliulis needs to utilize a glass needle to perform her test under microscope. The main objective is to use a small, sharp glass needle to probe cells under a microscope. A joystick is used for both position and velocity movement.Three M3-LS-1.8-6 Linear Smart Stages from New Scale Technologies were used to control and drive the needle. The micromanipulator offers sensitivity adjustment, speed control, set and return home. The project was previously installed and developed on arduino and was later
transported to raspberry pi platform.

## What is a Micromanipulator?
---------------------
A [micromanipulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromanipulator) is the device that is used to do manipulation and interact with testing samples under microscope. The Micromanipulator is controlled by a joystick and driven with three linear smart stages. The micromanipulator can achieve the precision of level of movement that couldn't be achieved by human hands and manual tools.
