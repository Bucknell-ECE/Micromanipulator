## Overview
-------------------
Dr. Paliulis, who is working for the Biology department at Bucknell University, is performing research on chromosomes. 
In order to perform her research, Dr. Paliulis needs to utilize a glass needle to perform her test under microscope. The main objective is to use a small, sharp glass needle to probe cells under a microscope. A joystick is used for both position and velocity movement.Three M3-LS-1.8-6 Linear Smart Stages from New Scale Technologies were used to control and drive the needle. The micromanipulator offers sensitivity adjustment, speed control, set and return home. The project was previously installed and developed on arduino and was later
transported to raspberry pi platform.

## What is a Micromanipulator?
---------------------
A [micromanipulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromanipulator) is the device that is used to do manipulation and interact with testing samples under microscope. The Micromanipulator is controlled by a joystick and driven with three linear smart stages. The micromanipulator can achieve the precision of level of movement that couldn't be achieved by human hands and manual tools.

<a name="PositionMode"></a>
### Position Mode
The designed micromanipulator provides user with position mode. The microneedle will be placed on the preset "home" position on the microscope stage. The user can also later redefine the "home" position by using "set home" key on Joystick. The user can move the Joystick to adjust the X and Y position of the microneedle and then pressed "ZUp" or "ZDown" button to adjust the Z position. When the user finishe operation and release all buttons, the microneedle will automatically return back to the "home" position.

## Testing and Configuration
--------------
### Joystick Guide
Button 2: Z Down </br>
Button 3: Z Up </br>
Button 4: Set Home </br>
Button 8: Z sensitivity increase </br>
Button 9: Z sensitivity decrease </br>
Button 10: Reset Home to the center of stage </br>
Button +/- : Adjusting the sensitivity of X and Y. Due to configuration issue, the "-" sign represent maximum sensitivity, the "+" sign
represent minimum sensitivity

### Linear Smart Stage Configuration:
**06**: Move Closed-Loop step </br>
<06 D[SSSSSSSS]> If D=1, motor runs forward. If D=0, motor runs in reverse. Set D to N to set the step size without moving the actuator. 
This command is used in the *startup* function to finish the start up steps. The *startup* function is not yet finished. 

**08**: Move to Target </br>
<08 TTTTTTTT> TTTTTTTT is the target position in encoder counts (HEX). </br> 
There is no reading back from this command. This command is used in function *goToLocation* to drive the stage to move </br>

**10**: View Closed-Loop Status and Position
<10>. Read back <10 SSSSSS PPPPPPPP EEEEEEEE>. </br>
SSSSSS is the motor status. </br>
PPPPPPPP is the absolute position in encoder count. </br>
EEEEEEEE is the position error in encoder counts. </br>
The table for motor status refer to Page 16-18 in M3-LS-1.8-6 Smart Stage manual </br>
This command is used in function *getPositionFromM3LS* </br>

**87**: Run Frequency Calibration </br>
<87 D[ XX]> D is the calibration movement direction and calibration type. </br>
If Bit 0 of D is 0, calibration run in reverse. Else, calibration runs in forward </br>
If Bit 1 of D is 0, frequency calibration sweep. Else, incremental frequency calibration sweep only </br>
If Bit 2 of D is 1, automated calibration sweep followed by an incremental frequency calibration sweep </br>
Bit 3 to 7 are all set to 0 </br>
This command is used in function *calibrate* </br>

### Rasberry Pi Terminal
Setting Linear Range </br>
Home axis [x,y,z] </br>
Boundries (4 numbers will be displayed, the first and third one are the distance from needle to the x boundries. The second and fouth one are the distance from needle to the y boundries.) </br>
Constraint Linear Range (The distance from needle to closest boundries) </br>
Scaled Range (Range of motion) </br>
XlimMin (Lower boundery of x) </br> 
xlimmax (Upper boundery of x)</br>
Ylimmin (Lower boundery of y)</br>
ylimmax (Upper boundery of y)</br>
Y Linear Range </br>
X Linear Range </br>
X, Y in scale of 1000 </br>

X position </br>
Y position </br>
