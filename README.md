# Micromanipulator
Dr. Paliulis, who is working for the Biology department at Bucknell University, is performing research on chromosomes. 
In order to perform her research, Dr. Paliulis needs to utilize a glass needle to perform her test under microscope. The main objective
is to use a small, sharp glass needle to probe cells under a microscope. A joystick is used for both position and velocity movement.
Three M3-LS-1.8-6 Linear Smart Stages from New Scale Technologies were used to control and drive the needle. The micromanipulator offers
sensitivity adjustment, speed control, set and return home. The project was previously installed and developed on arduino and was later
transported to raspberry pi platform.
